	 * This effect makes the player immune to accumulating food exhaustion. It is useless to all other entities.
	 * Normal exhausting actions such as running, jumping and attacking will not drain hunger or saturation.
	 * If the player can spend saturation to heal damage, the effect halts to let them do so, until they can't any more.
	 * This means players can grow hungry by healing damage, but no further than 1.5 points, allowing them to eat more and keep healing.
	 * <p>
	 * This method employs an Access Transformer exclusively to read the exhaustion value; it calls the proper functions to change it.
