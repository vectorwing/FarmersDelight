# Changelog

## 1.2.0

## Additions
- New foods:
  - Salmon Roll, Cod Roll and Kelp Roll - A new way to enjoy your fishing spoils, if you're equipped with watery crops;
    - A full Kelp Roll is quite awkward to eat, so it takes a while. But if you cut it on a Cutting Board, you get bite-sized snacks to eat quickly;
  - Bone Broth - Spelunking? In a pinch? Bring a Cooking Pot with you, and you'll be able to make a decent broth out of bone and cave vegetation!;
  - Mushroom Rice - A nourishing counterpart to Mushroom Stew, and a good sink for your mushroom colony farms;
- New blocks:
  - Sandy Shrub - A short plant which invades the beach coast, alongside Wild Cabbage and Sea Beet. Bone meal it to make more of it;
- New feast: **Rice Roll Medley!**
  - Display your knife skills with a selection of salmon, cod and kelp rolls!
  - Unlike other feasts, this gives individual rolls instead of meals. No, you can't put them back after taking one, it's bad manners!;
- New tag: `forge:dough`. Used to add modded dough items to FD's recipes, and populated by Wheat Dough by default;

## Updates
- Wild Crops have received some visual upgrades, both in art and in world generation!
  - Wild Carrots, being weeds, will strangle some grass out, creating small patches of Coarse Dirt;
  - Wild Potatoes now scatter individual Alliums around them, making a more natural bush;
  - Tomato Vines and Wild Potatoes now grow amidst a bush of local foliage;
  - Wild Cabbage and Sea Beet now grow amidst a patch of Sandy Shrub, a new beach plant;
- Updated a few recipes:
  - Barbecue on a Stick is now made from any cooked meat! Have your barbecue your way;
- All cooking recipes have received a bump in their experience reward, since the old ratios were very pitiful;
- Skillet damage has been slightly buffed;

## 0.6.0 / 1.1.0

### Additions
- Added some of this mod's items (ropes, seeds, meals, knives etc.) to many chest loot tables! I'll leave most of them for you to discover. ;)
- Added `add_loot_table` loot modifier:
  - Allows for adding unmodified extra loot rolls to specified `lootTable` paths;
  - This modifier is governed by the `generateFDChestLoot` config; if set to false, it doesn't do anything.
- New cutting recipes:
  - Stone + Pickaxe -> Cobblestone;
  - Quartz Block + Pickaxe -> 4 Nether Quartz
  - Ink Sac + Knife -> 2 Black Dye;
  - Gravel + Shovel -> Gravel, 10% Flint (infinite source);
  - Deepslate + Pickaxe -> Cobbled Deepslate (1.18);
  - Amethyst Block + Pickaxe -> 4 Amethyst Shards (1.18);
- Added Rotten Tomatoes:
  - Not all tomatoes are fresh off the vine. Rarely, you might end up plucking a bad one...
  - Rotten Tomatoes are inedible and uncookable; they are meant to be **thrown** at others! Splatter that unfunny friend of yours right in the face!
  - They are also more compostable than standard tomatoes (85% chance), in case you don't want them.

### Updates
- The Comfort effect has been redesigned:
  - It no longer provides immunity to Slowness, Weakness or Hunger;
  - Now, it extends natural regeneration (or provides it, if the gamerule is disabled), no matter how hungry you are;
  - A silver sheen will scroll through your hearts to indicate the effect is active.
- The Advancement tree has been redesigned, with more basic hints accessible at the start of a world;
- Updated a few crafting recipes:
  - Dumplings are now cooked with Wheat Dough instead of Raw Pasta;
  - Wheat Dough is now craftable from 3 Wheat, and either 1 Egg or 1 Water Bucket;
  - Raw Pasta is now made by cutting Wheat Dough in a Cutting Board;
- Foods have been rebalanced:
  - Nourishment and Comfort lengths have been tweaked, based on the complexity of the dish;
  - Sandwiches no longer provide burst effects, to make them on par with other handheld foods;
- Wandering Traders now sell the mod's seeds/plantables sometimes. This can be similarly disabled in the config;
- The modifier `add_item` can now safely specify a `count` for the added item (optional);
- Stoves now have custom death messages, if one's unlucky enough to die on top of them...;
- Safety Nets have a slightly taller hitbox, to make placement easier.

### Fixes
- Fixed configuration for generating Compost Heaps on villages not working;
- Fixed Lava Cauldrons not being valid heat sources;

## 1.0.4

## 1.0.1

### Additions

## 1.0.0
- 1.17 and 1.18 port! Codebase has been cleaned up and refactored;

### Breaking Changes
- Read this: https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/1.0-Breaking-Changes
- This port remaps a few blocks and items. This remap may sometimes fail due to mod interactions. **MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE TRYING TO MIGRATE OLD WORLDS!**
  - Remapped `rice_crop` to `rice`;
  - Remapped `rice_upper_crop` to `rice_panicles`;
  - Remapped all Pantries to Cabinets, in language and ID;
    - The game will attempt to migrate stored contents. If this fails, stored items will be deleted.
- (1.18+) Configs for Wild Crops frequencies have different values due to underlying system changes. They're much bigger numbers!
  - This may be re-tweaked in the future;

### Removals
- Removed `comfort_foods` tag. The mod now only adds the Comfort effect to vanilla SoupItems, which can be disabled in the config;

### Updates
- Moved Wild Rice from `small_flowers` to `tall_flowers`;
- Wild Crops, except for Wild Rice, can now provide effects when used to make Suspicious Stew. Curious? Try them for yourself! ;)
- Meal effect durations have been tweaked:
  - Both Comfort and Nourishment can now be obtained in ranges of 1, 3 and 5 minutes across meals;
  - Mushroom Stew and Beetroot Soup both grant 3 minutes of Comfort;
  - Rabbit Stew grants 5 minutes of Comfort, as well as a short burst of Jump Boost II;

## 0.5.5

### Updates
- Mutton Wrap no longer needs milk, and is made with an Onion instead of a Tomato;
- Cooking Pot is easier to mine by hand;
- Updated de_DE translation (thanks, DaLumma!);

### Fixes

  - This means any items in `comfort_foods` will work, but won't have an effect tooltip to them;

## 0.5.2

### Additions

### Additions
  - Added JEI information tabs to Knives and Ham;
  - Added `mushroom_colony_growable_on` tag: blocks that allow Mushroom Colonies to continue growing until mature;
    - This tag DOES NOT make the block form colonies! Only Rich Soil can do so for now;
  - Added compatibility with Create's Potato Cannon!
    - Cabbage packs a punch, but is cumbersome to reload;
    - Tomatoes are light, rapid-fire and embarassing to get hit by;
    - Onions are mostly the same as potatoes;
    - Whole pies work like the Pumpkin Pie. Their slices (and Pumpkin Slices) can be fired rapidly instead.
### Updates
  - Cooking Pot and Skillet are a bit easier to break by hand;
  - Melon Popsicles now douse flames when consumed, instead of giving Fire Resistance;
  - Updated ja_JP translation (thanks, CKenJa!)
### Fixes
  - Fix Skillet not saving total cooking times, making it cook items rapidly on world reload;

## 0.5.0

### Breaking changes (BACKUP YOUR SAVES!)
- This update causes a few breaking changes. Follow this link for more info:
- https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/0.5-Breaking-Changes

### Additions
- **Skillet** - A portable food-cooking utensil with a powerful swing!
    - Can be placed as a block (shift-use) or operated from your hand, if near a heat source;
        - Being on fire counts as a heat source when handheld!
    - Acts as a heavyweight melee weapon, packing extra knockback, but with very slow swings;
    - 1 second slower than a Smoker by default, but cooks progressively faster when enchanted with **Fire Aspect**;
    - Cannot interact with Hoppers as of now. This is pending a thinking-over later.
- New foods:
    - **Bacon and Eggs** - Plenty of cholesterol for a fresh morning!
- New drinks:
    - **Apple Cider** - A warm and simple drink to toughen you up with **Absorption** for a minute;
    - **Melon Juice** - Refreshing and healthy! **Heals 1 heart** instantly;
- **Canvas Rug** - A fuzzy, rudimentary floor cover made of Canvas;
- **Canvas Signs** - Painterly signs with a **dyeable background** and a smooth writing surface!
    - The sign is "uncolored" when first crafted, using the natural beige tone of Canvas;
    - Can be crafted with any normal dye to color its background;
    - Text can be dyed as usual by right-clicking the sign with a dye item;
    - Signs with a "dark" background color start off with white text. This can be customized in the config.

### Updates
- All workstations have been **optimized** for better performance, and now cache the previous recipes when processing;
- Pie and cake slices had their Speed buff shortened to 30 seconds; 
- Cooking Pot:
    - You now get **experience points** from cooking!
        - Just like a Furnace, retrieving meals from the output slot will reward you the experience stored so far;
        - Mining the pot will also release all stored experience;
    - The pot can now be heated **through** `heat_conductors`, up to 1 block of space:
        - By default, this applies to the metallic Hopper, letting you heat your food AND extract it at the same time!
        - Built-in support for Create's Chutes, and 1.17 Copper Blocks are planned to be tagged as such in the future;
    - You can now hang the pot from a **handle**!
        - Place the pot from under a block, and it will display a handle;
        - If a handle is shown, the pot won't display a tray at all;
        - You can toggle between tray and handle by sneak-right-clicking the pot.
    - The pot emits a new, custom steam particle when boiling;
    - The boiling sound becomes more "soupy" when the pot is storing a meal;
- Stove:
    - You can now use **Fire Charges** to light them;
    - You can now use any item with a "shovel" ToolType to extinguish them;
    - Cookable food can be placed on a Stove that isn't lit;
- Cutting Board:
    - Cutting recipes can now define a **drop chance** for each output item!
        - Chance is optional, and outputs are 100% guaranteed by default;
        - **Fortune** increases chances, if the given tool is enchanted with it. This bonus can be tweaked in the configs;
        - In FD, chances have been given to some flower-cutting and salvaging recipes;
        - Check the GitHub wiki to see how the new syntax works.
    - Updated JEI recipe displays to have dynamic outputs, and to also show drop chances;
    - Carved tools have been mirrored, so as to avoid cutting across the handle gap;
    - New cutting recipes: Wild Crops, Leather Horse Armor
- Knives:
    - Reduced swing speeds slightly;
- Rice:
    - The old, legacy form of the Rice Crop (`tall_rice_crop`) has been **permanently removed** in favor of the new one (`rice_upper_crop`). See the **Breaking Changes** for more info;
    - The Rice crop now only gives 1 panicle at a time, and bone meal is a bit less effective. This was done to control its excessive supply a bit more;

### Fixes
- Fix circular texture reference in some model templates, which caused lots of log spam with CTM;
- Fix most sounds being set to `stream` when they shouldn't be;
- Fix mugs rendering incorrectly when in the off-hand;

  - Small flowers can be cut to yield twice as much dye per usual;

  - https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Cutting-Board-Recipes
- Vanilla soups and stews now stack up to 16, much like meals from this mod! (thank you, bagel!)
  - By default, this affects exclusively `SoupItem`'s from vanilla, using a list inside the configs. You can add more items to it, but it only affects `SoupItem` items;
  - You can configure to treat the list of items as a deny-list instead, making EVERY `SoupItem` stack to 16, except the ones listed in the config. This affects other mods, so be careful!
  - This feature can be disabled entirely in the configs.
- Dog Food and Horse Feed now consult tags for eligible entities to feed:
  - `dog_food_users` determines which living entities can be fed Dog Food;
  - `horse_feed_users` determines which living entities can be fed Horse Feed;

- Rich Soil now emits green stars when boosting a plant. Should hopefully not be exaggerated;
- Fixes:
  - Rich Soil now respects OnCropsGrow Forge events. This fixes compatibility with Serene Seasons, but there could be more mods benefitting from it;
  - World gen code reordered a bit, should hopefully prevent crashes with OpenJ9 (but update OpenJ9 anyway, if you use it);
  - Tomatoes are now recognized as a CROP PlantType, to better integrate with modded farmlands (thank you, Foam!);

    - Bacon Sandwich;
    - Usable in all Porkchop-related recipes;
  - Ham: Porkchop's older sibling!
    - Slay Pigs or Hoglins with a Knife for a chance of scavenging a Ham piece or two;
    - Ham can only be smoked, and it takes a little longer than usual;

  - Melon Popsicle: When eaten, grants a very short burst of Fire Resistance in a pinch;
- Updated the Cutting Board:
  - Recipes can now specify a ToolType for axes, pickaxes and shovels instead of imaginary forge tags!

## 0.2.4a

## 0.2.4
- The Rice crop has been redesigned!
  - The top half of the crop can now be harvested individually. The bottom half will stay planted, and eventually regrow a top half;
  - Bottom half yields a single pile of Rice when broken;
  - Top half is a standard crop, which yields Rice Panicles when fully grown, or Rice/Straw when harvested with a Knife;
  - Fully compatible with vanilla pistons, mechanical automation methods, Quark's simple harvesting, Immersive Engineering's Garden Cloche, and Botany Pots;
  - Existing Rice crops planted in the world will remain as the old form for compatibility. Simply harvest them and replant rice to get the new form!
- Wild Rice now generates in Swamps, Jungles and Bamboo Jungles:
  - Somewhat more common than other wild crops, due to the rarity of these biomes;
  - Yields a single pile of Rice, and can be sheared.
- Seed-bearing Wild Crops (cabbage, beet and tomato) have a small chance of dropping an edible produce when harvested;
- Wild Crop bone meal action temporarily removed due to an exploit;
- Fixed Dog Food:
  - When fed to your pet wolf, it fully heals them and grants them Speed, Strength and Resistance;
- Added Horse Feed:
  - When fed to any tamed ridable mob (horse, donkey, llama etc.), it fully heals them and grants them Speed II and Jump Boost;
  - Does not work for Pigs and Striders, as they cannot be tamed;
- When players have the Nourished effect, the hunger bar will look gilded and shiny:
  - The gilded coating will visually "peel in half" when the player is spending saturation to heal damage;
  - This overlay can be disabled in the new "farmnersdelight-client.toml" config;
- If a bell has ropes hanging from under it, players can ring the bell by right-clicking the rope column (24 blocks max.);
- Some JEI quality-of-life features:
  - Press "uses" (U) on a Stove to see the Campfire Cooking recipe tab;
  - Press "uses" (U) on a container item (e.g. Bowl) to see which Cooking Pot recipes it can be served on;
  - Cooking Pot recipes now have a "Move Items" transfer button when checking recipes on it;
- Graphics updates for some blocks and items;
- Resource pack makers: I was previously using 'textures/blocks' instead of 'textures/block'. This version fixes it, so you may have to change it too.
- Translation updates:
  - Updated Chinese (thanks to WuzgXY-GitHub, TUsama and ChillirCR!);
  - Updated German (thanks to SebastianD334 and Moralle!);
  - Added Korean (thanks to qkrehf2!);
  - Added Russian (thanks to GrayPix and Kanspirians!);
  - Added French (thanks to Derrias!);
  - Added Japanese (thanks to FEMT1915!).

## 0.2.3
1.16.3+
- Re-implemented world generation to the new .json system:
  - Configs for wild patches have been changed, and are using new defaults;
  - Beach wild patches (Wild Cabbage and Sea Beet) now use a different weight pattern, so values are similar to other crops;
  - These two should change themselves on all instances, but we advise all players and modpack makers to reset their configs once, if migrating.
  
1.15.2+
- Adds Compost Heaps to village generation
  - These structures house heaps of Organic Compost, which farmers lay down to decompose into Rich Soil. Each biome has a different composting strategy based on their biome and climate!
  - Some of them have small farms mixed in, or examples of other mechanics;
  - They often have a few blocks of Rich Soil ready for taking!
- Adds 3 new meals: Cooked Rice, Grilled Salmon and Baked Cod Stew;
- Adds Tatami, a traditional flooring based on straw and canvas:
  - Tatami Blocks place as a "half-mat" by default. Placing another tatami against them will complete a "full-mat" pair! You can sneak-place to suppress pairing;
  - Tatami Mats are carpet-thin, come in Full and Half, and can be interchanged to and fro via crafting. They have a simpler placement and behave like carpets.
  - Thanks to Vazkii for sharing some placement code with me! A similar block to Tatami should soon be in Quark as well!

- Mulch has been renamed and remapped to Rich Soil - a more sensible name for its function.

  - Some errors from other mods on world load might interrupt the remapping. If anything wrong happens, address the errors and try again with a backup.
