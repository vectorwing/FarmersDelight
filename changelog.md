# Changelog

## 0.2.3
1.16.3+
- Re-implemented world generation to the new .json system:
  - Configs for wild patches have been changed, and are using new defaults;
  - Beach wild patches (Wild Cabbage and Sea Beet) now use a different weight pattern, so values are similar to other crops;
  - These two should change themselves on all instances, but we advise all players and modpack makers to reset their configs once, if migrating.
  
1.15.2+
- Adds Compost Heaps to village generation
  - These structures house heaps of Organic Compost, which farmers lay down to decompose into Rich Soil. Each biome has a different composting strategy based on their biome and climate!
  - Some of them have small farms mixed in, or examples of other mechanics;
  - They often have a few blocks of Rich Soil ready for taking!
- Adds 3 new meals: Cooked Rice, Grilled Salmon and Baked Cod Stew;
- Adds Tatami, a traditional flooring based on straw and canvas:
  - Tatami Blocks place as a "half-mat" by default. Placing another tatami against them will complete a "full-mat" pair! You can sneak-place to suppress pairing;
  - Tatami Mats are carpet-thin, come in Full and Half, and can be interchanged to and fro via crafting. They have a simpler placement and behave like carpets.
  - Thanks to Vazkii for sharing some placement code with me! A similar block to Tatami should soon be in Quark as well!
- Rename my "unofficial" Forge tool tags to be fully plural;
- Improves configs and integration options for modpack makers
- Prettifies the mod's meta files, and the info on the Mods page of Minecraft
- Makes Wild Patches non-replaceable like Tall Grass, closes issue #70
- Fixes containers vanishing if used to right-click an empty pot, closes issue #71
- Removes knives from being a crafting ingredient, delegating it to the Cutting Board if needed
  - Fixes Grindstone repairing for knives, and some duplication cases with other mods
- More extensions to IE and MCAbnormals integration;
- Straw harvesting now checks "farmersdelight:straw_harvesters" for items that can harvest straw from grassy plants.

1.15.2+
- Mulch has been renamed and remapped to Rich Soil - a more sensible name for its function.
  - BACKUP YOUR WORLDS!! The mod will try to remap existing mulch, so you won't lose your progress.
  - Some errors from other mods on world load might interrupt the remapping. If anything wrong happens, address the errors and try again with a backup.
  - Treat this as a breaking change. While existing mulch will usually be remapped safely, it's better to start a new world if you're not sure.
- Adds the Cutting Board - a hard surface to split items apart using certain tools
  - Tool items can be carved into the board for display by sneak-right-clicking;
  - Knives can portion meats and some fruits, to be more efficient when cooking meals;
  - Pickaxes can separate brick blocks back into individual bricks;
  - Axes can strip logs and harvest the removed tree bark, useful for composting;
    - With this change, Knives are no longer able to strip logs for bark;
  - Shears can salvage Saddles. Maybe more later!
  - Current recipes are proofs of concept; we plan to add more in the future!
- Adds Pantries - decorative storage blocks for every wood type;
- Adds Pies - placeable desserts made from often overlooked sweet ingredients!
  - Apple Pie, Sweet Berry Cheesecake and Chocolate Pie;
  - They have 4 slices, can be eaten by hand, or sliced off with Knives;
  - All pies provide a brief boost in Speed;
  - Pumpkin Pie compatibility planned for the future.
- Pumpkins can now be cut into 4 edible slices, to contrast with a Melon's 9 slices;
- Several tagging changes, both mod-scope and Forge-scope, to allow more customization;
- Many blocks in Farmer's Delight now send comparator signals;
- Flammable blocks and items are now fuels!
- New food effect: Comfort
  - Makes the user immune to cold and sickness (Hunger, Slowness and Weakness), and instantly heals these effects when obtained;
  - Provided by soups and stews, which are traditionally warm and wintry foods;
- Small tweaks to Tomato crop harvesting;
- Adds a few strong effects to vanilla soup items, to make them more interesting to consume;
- Wild Crops can now be multiplied by bone-mealing, at a small chance of success;
- General asset improvements.
